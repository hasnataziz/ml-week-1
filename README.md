Machine Learning Project: Introduction to Machine Learning with Python
Welcome to my introductory machine learning project! In this project, I explore the fundamentals of machine learning using Python, focusing on the famous Iris dataset.

Overview
This project is part of my learning journey into machine learning. I chose the Iris dataset, which includes 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species, each described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Objectives
Environment Setup: Ensure Python and Jupyter Notebooks are installed. Install necessary libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.
Data Exploration: Load the Iris dataset using pandas. Explore data structure and statistics using describe(), info(), and value_counts().
Visualizations: Create histograms and scatter plots to understand data distributions and relationships between features. Use seaborn's pairplot for comprehensive visualization.
Files Included
ML_Intro_with_Python.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for data loading, exploration, and visualization.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
Getting Started
To run the notebook locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository: git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git](https://github.com/hasnataziz/ml-week-1)
Navigate to the project directory: cd your-repository
Open Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook 
Open ML_Intro_with_Python.ipynb and run each cell to execute the code step-by-step.
Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install them using pip:

Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Results and Insights
Through this project, I gained insights into:

Setting up a Python environment for data science.
Basic data exploration techniques using pandas.
Visualization methods to interpret data patterns and relationships.
Future Enhancements
In future iterations, I plan to:

Implement machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling on the Iris dataset.
Explore other datasets to deepen my understanding of different machine learning techniques.
